# Building Recommendation Systems using Python

I am already close to finishing this project, and will be updating this README page on a daily basis till I can explain the whole code and the logic.

This is a follow-along practice, using this tutorial: [Beginner Tutorial: Recommender Systems in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/recommender-systems-python)

I will use this knowledge I gain and try to create a project made form scratch on my own.
